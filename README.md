# OS_LAB_2 -> Jacob Barnum
Lab writeup for Operating Systems (Lab 2)

I gave my USB to you for boot testing. Thanks why the Boot screenshot is still missing. In addition I had to restart my VM to get the 2 logical partition file systems to initiate so I lost the initial terminal output for the exfat and NFTS file systems. What you see is the output after running the initializtion commands for a second time.

## Partition Table:

## VFAT file system:

## Booting ESXI:
I left my USB with you for testing. You just told me to include in my writeup that I was waiting on you to test it.
